<h1 style="text-align: Center;">About Me</h1>
<br>
Welcome to my corner of the web. As a dedicated and skilled journeyman technician based in Redmond, Washington, with over six years of experience in fiber and data infrastructure. I thrive in challenging environments and am passionate about adopting new technologies to solve complex problems and enhance efficiency.

I'm passionate about, currently pursuing and diligently working towards obtaining my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to further strengthen my knowledge and skills in the Cybersecurity field. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to leverage my experiences, including my experience from PCD and P3 as a Senior Test Engineer Field interoperability Testing (FIT), and contribute to the dynamic and innovative environment. I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of industry trends.

My recent completion of the Foundations of Cybersecurity course on Coursera is a testament to my dedication to expanding my knowledge. You can verify my Coursera achievements here. [Coursera - Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://coursera.org/verify/AQM35Z3XBGM2)

In my most recent role at Prime Electric, I played a crucial role in fiber OSP installation and splicing for the Microsoft campus vault(s) fiber trace. Before that, during my tenure at NetCom, Inc., I implemented infrastructure for Boeing Data Center testing requirements, showcasing my ability to work with high-security level access and provide detailed documentation for test results

As a journeyman technician, I have a diverse skill set that includes proficiency in wireless access points, fiber optics, and AWS Welder Certification. I am currently seeking new opportunities to contribute to a dynamic and innovative team that values quality, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
