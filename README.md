About Me
Ever since the first computer arrived at our home in the '80s, I've been on a self-taught journey of exploration and discovery. From tinkering with Apple IIe's in 8th grade to navigating the complexities of DOS, Windows 3.1, and even AOL, my fascination with technology has been a constant in my life.

I vividly remember the excitement of building my first computer, disassembling it, understanding its intricacies, and putting it back togetherâ€”all in pursuit of making it work better, faster, and more efficiently. This hands-on approach fueled my passion for programming, as I began creating my programs to meet my unique needs.

The advent of Google's search engine revolutionized my learning experience, providing me with access to a vast array of resources that accelerated my growth. With MS Word and Google by my side, I honed my writing and spelling skills, all while expanding my knowledge base through online research.

Exploring Linux, bulletin boards, and dial-up connections became a regular pastime, alongside delving into the world of gaming and experimenting with various hacker CDs. While I treaded cautiously to avoid damaging the computers I worked on, these experiences ignited my curiosity and fueled my desire to learn more. I discovered platforms like Happy Hackers dot ORG, where I engaged in ethical hacking practices, honed my cybersecurity skills, and connected with like-minded individuals.

My educational journey continued through computer classes in high school, where I delved into topics ranging from typing and computer art to 3D animation and programming. At Coastline Community College, I further honed my skills in website design, programming languages like Java, XML, MS Visual Basic, Access, Excel, SQL, Macros, and ColdFusion, and networking technologies like Cisco IOS switches.

Transitioning to Westwood College, I delved into the world of gaming software development, experiencing programming languages such as C, C++, BASIC, and delving deep into game design and theory. Along the way,

Today, with the advent of virtual machines and other sandbox environments, I continue to explore, innovate, and learn without the fear of damaging physical hardware. My journey as a self-taught technologist remains an ongoing adventure, fueled by curiosity, passion, and a relentless drive for knowledge.

I thrive in challenging environments and am passionate about adopting new technologies to solve complex problems and enhance efficiency.

Currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of industry trends. My recent completion of the Foundations of Cybersecurity course on Coursera is a testament to my dedication to expanding my knowledge. You can verify my Coursera achievements [here](https://coursera.org/verify/AQM35Z3XBGM2).

These are the other courses that I am working on, in conjunction with the above; Python for Everybody Specialization - Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python), Digital Footprint, Cybersecurity Attack and Defense Fundamentals Specialization - Digital Forensics Essentials (DFE), Google UX Design Professional Certificate - Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts.

I recently completed a Knowledge Check in Cisco Networking Devices and Initial Configuration, marking a significant step in my journey to enhance my networking skills. While I haven't been actively using Cisco Packet Tracer or engaging with the Academy training for some time, I've reignited my passion for learning and exploration in the networking realm.

The catalyst for this rejuvenation? The all-new Skills for All initiative by Cisco Networking Academy features the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ 8.2.1! What's even better? It's now compatible with Linux, opening up a world of possibilities for seamless simulation and visualization.

But wait, there's more! I've also embraced the cutting-edge CyberSecurity Essentials Virtual Machine for Oracle VirtualBox. This dynamic resource houses a plethora of Cisco Networking Academy Lab VM Workstations, catering to various cybersecurity domains such as Cybersecurity Essentials, Endpoint Security, and Network Defense.

With these resources at my disposal, I'm embarking on an exhilarating journey to further my knowledge and expertise. My immediate focus? Completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, leveraging the rich insights and practical skills acquired through these immersive learning experiences.

I've already installed Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.1 on a Linux Ubuntu environment, complete with CLI capabilities, and I'm thrilled to dive into the Network Security courses. It's exhilarating to revisit familiar territories and explore new horizons, all in the pursuit of personal and professional growth.

Here's to embracing change, seizing opportunities, and continuously evolving in the ever-dynamic world of networking and cybersecurity!
